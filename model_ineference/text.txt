 There's two types of comments, right? Like, we'll do this. I'm gonna show you two types of comments here. We're gonna do a comment that says, this set's unbreaking to one. This is a shit comment. Do not do this comment. This is a bad comment. Instead, we set unbreaking here because this item will disappear otherwise when used. That's a good comment. We put reasoning instead of what it does. Why it's there, not what is it doing. Not just what. Why. Why. Why is the important part?
